# How to make a Demo
- [Video Walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/e7d93f21af2440fda3b36d90187be2ce)


## Description
This demo walks through the steps to create a demo. The purpose of making demos is to encourage a 2 step approach to development:
- Learning
- Execution

Most poeple will spend all of their time in the execution phase, and when they encounter something they have not done before, the learn while they execute. This slows down execution, and can lead to things being half learned for the sake of finishing a task as fast as possible.

Instead of approaching the need to learn as an obsticle or interruption, we need to treat it as a proper step in the development process. If you encounter something you have not done before, it is helpful to take yourself out of execution mode, and go into learning mode. 

This repository is meant to faciliate this process. Each folder represents a topic or thing that needs to be learned. We create code, a README, and a walkthrough video via Loom. 

In order to create a demo, you need to deploy a working version, which means you need to also have an AWS account (personal or provided by company). The steps are as follows:
- create folder of thing you need to learn
- build that thing
- deploy that thing
- record a Loom video which does the following:
    - 1. Demonstrate the end product with the deployed demo
    - 2. Walk through the code that underneath the solution
- Add video link to README.md
- Let everyone on your team know this new resource exists to they can benefit from all the work and learning you have done via Slack.
